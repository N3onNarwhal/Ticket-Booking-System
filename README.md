# Ticket-Booking-System
This is a ticket booking system for a movie theater auditorium that uses linked lists to store data.

The terminal is used to accept user input and print a final report including total sales, number of seats, etc.
The final auditorium is printed to "A1.txt".

The Auditorium and Node classes are implemented as generic classes, though the instance of Auditorium in Main has Nodes that store Seats (non-generic class). Several functions in Auditorium.java are created with this in mind. Instances of Auditorium are stored as a singly linked list, where each element of the singly linked list of Nodes stores a doubly linked list of Nodes.

"A1base.txt" and "A2base.txt" are files that can be used for testing.

Any constructive criticism is greatly appreciated. Thank you for checking out my program!
