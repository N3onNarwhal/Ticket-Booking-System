# Ticket-Booking-System
This is a ticket booking system for a movie theater auditorium. 
The program was developed using Visual Studio Code, and it is coded in Java. 

The terminal is used to accept user input and print a final report including total sales, number of seats, etc.

The Auditorium and Node classes are implemented as generic classes, though the instance of Auditorium in Main has Nodes that store Seats (non-generic class).
Auditorium is stored as a singly linked list, where each element of the singly linked list of Nodes stores a doubly linked list of Nodes.

Any constructive criticism is greatly appreciated. Thank you for checking out my program!
